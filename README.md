# Vidora

Professional, minimal README for the Vidora video conferencing project.

Vidora is a browser-based video conferencing app using WebRTC for peer-to-peer media and Socket.IO for signaling. The project includes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node/Express backend that handles authentication and signaling.

## Key Features

- Sign in / Sign up (basic auth flows)
- Real-time signaling with Socket.IO
- Peer-to-peer video (WebRTC) with a responsive multi-tile grid
- In-meeting chat and optional screen sharing

## Repo Layout

- `Backend/` — Node.js + Express + Socket.IO server
- `Frontend/Vidora/` — React (Vite) app with UI components and WebRTC logic

## Quick Start (development)

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (16+)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) MongoDB for persistent user storage

1) Backend

```powershell
cd Backend
npm install
# configure environment (see below)
npm run dev
```

2) Frontend

```powershell
cd Frontend/Vidora
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5175` (Vite default) to use the app. The backend is expected at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Configuration

Backend environment variables (examples):

- `PORT` — API + signaling server port (default: 8000)
- `MONGO_URI` — MongoDB connection string (if using DB)
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret for auth tokens

Update API base URLs in `Frontend/Vidora/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` and `Frontend/Vidora/src/pages/VideoMeet.jsx` if your backend runs at a different address.

## Local Testing Tips

- Use multiple browser tabs (or different browsers/incognito windows) with different usernames to simulate multiple participants.
- Grant camera/microphone permissions when prompted.
- If remote video tiles do not appear:
	- Verify the backend (Socket.IO) server is running and reachable.
	- Check browser console for socket connection logs and errors.
	- Ensure the frontend uses the Socket.IO client (`socket.io-client`) rather than raw WebSocket.

## Troubleshooting

- `getUserMedia` errors: ensure the page has permission to use the camera/microphone.
- Socket connection errors: confirm Socket.IO client and server versions are compatible and the server URL is correct.
- If ICE candidates fail across networks, consider adding a TURN server for reliable NAT traversal.

## Developer Notes

- Some code paths use legacy `addStream`/`onaddstream` APIs. You may prefer `addTrack` / `ontrack` for new work.
- Files containing JSX should use `.jsx` extension to avoid esbuild/Vite parsing issues.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Implement and test your changes.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description and testing steps.

## License

This project does not include a license file by default. Add a `LICENSE` if you wish to make it open source.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `.env.example` for the backend
- Provide Docker / docker-compose examples to run backend + frontend
- Add short developer run scripts or a CONTRIBUTING.md

Tell me which of these you'd like next.
