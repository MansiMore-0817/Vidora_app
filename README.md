🌐 Overview

Vidora is a full-stack video conferencing platform built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with WebRTC for peer-to-peer streaming and Socket.io for real-time communication.
It allows users to host or join meetings, chat live, and share screens — all from the browser.

✨ Features

🎥 Multi-participant video calls — responsive grid layout that adapts to 1→N participants for smooth group meetings.

🔍 Camera preview / Pre-join screen — preview and set display name before entering a call.

🖥️ Screen sharing — share any tab/window using getDisplayMedia() for presentations and demos.

💬 In-call real-time chat — instant messaging inside the room, keeps conversation synced for all participants.

🕒 Meeting history — persistent records of joined rooms (code, host, timestamp) for easy audit and recall.

🔐 Authentication & sessions — signup / signin flow with session handling to protect user access.


### Performance and reliability metrics

- ⚡ UI load time (local dev): DOMContentLoaded ≈ 468 ms, Full load ≈ 471 ms (Chrome DevTools).  
- 👥 Peer tests: 4–8 participants in local P2P tests (estimate — run local multi-tab/device tests to confirm).  
- 📡 Screen share delay: ~600ms (local estimate; measure with timestamp overlay for exact value).  
- 💬 Chat median RTT: 40–80ms (LAN estimate; verify via socket ping/pong).  
- 🔐 Auth response time: ~150ms (local estimate; verify via `curl`).  
- 🗂️ History DB query: <200ms (local MongoDB estimate; verify with console timing).

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### 🌐 Frontend
- ⚛️ **React.js** (Hooks-based architecture)
- 🎨 **Material UI (MUI)** for component styling
- 🖼️ **Material UI Icons** for modern iconography
- 🎭 **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first custom UI
- 🔌 **Socket.IO Client** for real-time communication
- 📹 **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer video, audio & screen sharing

### 🛠️ Backend
- 🟩 **Node.js** + **Express.js**
- 📡 **Socket.IO** for WebRTC signaling & live events
- 🍃 **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** for data storage
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** for secure access


Architecture:

Peer-to-peer connections via WebRTC

Signaling handled by Socket.io

REST APIs for users & meeting management

## Repo Layout

- `Backend/` — Node.js + Express + Socket.IO server
- `Frontend/Vidora/` — React (Vite) app with UI components and WebRTC logic

## Quick Start (development)

# 🔧 Installation (Developer)

> Tested on Node 18+, npm 9+, MongoDB local.

```bash
# 1. Clone
 git clone https://github.com/MansiMore-0817/Vidora_app.git

cd <repo>

# 2. Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT)
npm install
npm run dev         # or `npm start` depending on your scripts

# 3. Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
# put screenshots into ./screenshots (see mapping at project root)
npm run start       # opens http://localhost:5173 (or your configured port)
```


- If remote video tiles do not appear:
	- Verify the backend (Socket.IO) server is running and reachable.
	- Check browser console for socket connection logs and errors.
	- Ensure the frontend uses the Socket.IO client (`socket.io-client`) rather than raw WebSocket.

## Troubleshooting

- `getUserMedia` errors: ensure the page has permission to use the camera/microphone.
- Socket connection errors: confirm Socket.IO client and server versions are compatible and the server URL is correct.
- If ICE candidates fail across networks, consider adding a TURN server for reliable NAT traversal.

## About Me / What This Project Demonstrates

Vidora showcases my ability to build real-time, full-stack applications with clean architecture and modern frontend design. Through this project, I worked with WebRTC, Socket.IO, React, and Node.js to create a functional video-conferencing experience similar to real-world platforms.

This project demonstrates my skills in:

Real-time communication: WebRTC media handling, signaling, ICE/SDP flow, multi-peer connections.

Full-stack development: React + MUI on the frontend, Node.js + Express + Socket.IO on the backend.

System architecture thinking: stateless signaling, P2P media routing, STUN/TURN, room state management.

Problem-solving: debugging browser differences, managing media tracks, preventing leak issues, handling dynamic UI changes.

Product-focused UI: responsive layouts, screen sharing workflows, intuitive controls for camera/mic.

Overall, Vidora reflects my interest in real-time systems, modern web technologies, and building projects that feel practical, polished, and production-ready.


## Tech Decisions & Tradeoffs

# WebRTC Mesh vs SFU

Chose peer-to-peer mesh for simplicity, low latency, and learning fundamentals.
Tradeoff: not ideal for large meetings; SFU would scale better.

# Socket.IO for Signaling

Used Socket.IO for stable rooms and auto-reconnection.
Tradeoff: slightly more overhead than raw WebSockets.

# React + MUI

Selected React for component structure and MUI for fast, polished UI.
Tradeoff: heavier than custom styling.

$ P2P Media Routing

Kept audio/video P2P to reduce server load.
Tradeoff: requires TURN for strict networks; limits scalability.

# Stateless Signaling Server

Server only relays messages, no media.
Tradeoff: no persistent chat or analytics.

# Public STUN Server

Used Google STUN for convenience.
Tradeoff: not reliable for production; TURN still needed.
----------------------------------------------

🧪 How to test locally (quick)

Start backend, then frontend.

Open two separate browser windows (or different devices on the same network) and join the same room code — confirm you see each other's video.

Test screen share (Share Chrome Tab / Window) and watch for the browser sharing popup.

Use the chat box to exchange messages in the room.

Check History page — entries should appear when users join.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Developer Notes

- Some code paths use legacy `addStream`/`onaddstream` APIs. You may prefer `addTrack` / `ontrack` for new work.
- Files containing JSX should use `.jsx` extension to avoid esbuild/Vite parsing issues.
